  Felix is a Programming Language researcher at
  <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/research/">Mozilla Research</a>.
</p>
<p>
  He lives in Paris, but his French is poor.
  <em>Il habite à Paris, mais son français est pas bien.</em>
</p>
<p>
Pre-history: Felix received a Bachelors
degree in 2000 and an M.Eng in 2001, both in EECS from MIT.
After graduating from MIT, he worked at Green Hills Software.
Then he returned to Boston to pursue a Ph.D in Programming Languages at
<a href="http://www.neu.edu/">Northeastern University</a>'s 
<a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/">College of Computer and Information Science</a>.
Near the end of his Ph.D work, he joined Adobe to
work on the
<!-- <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/tamarin/"> -->
Actionscript Virtual Machine.

<p>
To everyone who told me that I should not start a new job until after I defend
my thesis: you were right.</p>
<p>(To the one person who told me that
I should wait to join my wife, far from university,
until after I defend my thesis: you must have been wrong,
because I cannot imagine life any other way.)

<div class="box" id="rust_box">
  <a id="rust"></a>
  <h2 class="boxtitle">Rust</h2>
  <p>
  <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> is a new exciting systems programming language.
  Rust combines the speed and low-level access provided by C with safety
  <em>surpassing</em> that provided by memory-safe languages like Java.
  </p>
  <p>
    How is Rust more safe than Java? Because in addition to ensuring
    memory safety, Rust guarantees programs are <em>data-race free</em>,
    eliminating a swath of bugs that plague programs for parallel
    processors.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, Rust has a strong community culture. From the start,
    the project has actively worked to foster an
    <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/conduct.html">open and
    welcoming</a> environment, encouraging programmers of all
    backgrounds (from catagory-theory nerds to script-kiddies to grey
    beards) to come join us and help save the world from segmentation
    faults. I am a proud member of the Rust
    <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/team.html#Moderation-team">moderation team</a>
    that works to maintain that social environment.

<h2 class="boxtitle">Teaching</h2>
<p>In Fall semester of 2009, Felix was a teaching assistant
<!-- for <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/csg107/">CSG 107</a>, -->
for 
<a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/107-f09/index.html">CS 5010</a>, 
(which was just a renaming of CSG 107: "Program Design Paradigms"),
again taught by Professor <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/">Matthias Felleisen</a>.
</p>

<p>In Spring semester of 2009, Felix was a teaching assistant
for <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/csu211/">CSU 211</a>,
taught by <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/samth/">
Sam Tobin-Hochstadt</a>.
</p>

<p>In Fall semester of 2008, Felix was a teaching assistant
<!-- for <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/csg107/">CSG 107</a>, -->
for 
<a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/107-f08/index.html">CSG 107</a>, 
taught by Professor <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/">Matthias Felleisen</a>.
</p>

<p>In Spring semester of 2008, Felix taught
<a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/csg111/">CSG 111</a>, 
in concert with Professor
<a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/will/">Will Clinger</a>.
CSG 111 is also known as <em>Principles of Programming Languages</em>.
Felix enjoys the
<a href="objects-lecture/index.html">objects lecture</a> he gave
in that course (and recently updated for a guest lecture 
in <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/csg711/">CSG 711</a>).
</p>

<p>In Spring semester of 2006, 
Felix taught <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/csu211/">CSU 211</a>
as an instructor of record.
CSU 211 is also known as <em>Fundamentals of Computer Science I</em>.</p>
<p>
Felix was a teaching assistant for CSU 211
(taught by Professor
<a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/">Felleisen</a>) 
in the Fall semester of 2005 and 
in the Fall semester of 2003.
</p>

<p>When he was at MIT, Felix was a teaching assistant for 
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.170/www/">6.170</a>, 
<em>Laboratory in Software Engineering</em>, for 
the 
<a href="http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.170/old-www/2000-Spring/">spring 2000</a>, 
<a href="http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.170/old-www/2000-Fall/">fall 2000</a>,

<h2 class="boxtitle">Research</h2>
<p>
Felix currently researches garbage collection with bounded pause times
via heap partitioning.  
He is using the 
<a href="http://larceny.ccs.neu.edu/">Larceny</a> implementation
of the <a href="http://schemers.org/">Scheme</a> programming language as the basis for his experiments.
</p>
<p>
In Summer of 2009, Felix was co-author on 
a <a href="Published/klock-rgc-schemeworkshop-2009.html">paper 
about Regional Garbage Collection</a>
and the mathematics behind its work scheduling policies.
</p>
<p>
In Spring of 2008, Felix completed his 
<a href="comprehensive-exam.html">comprehensive exam</a>.
</p>
<p>
Felix presented 
<a href="Published/klock-ffi-schemeworkshop-2008.html">Larceny's FFI</a>
at 
Scheme Workshop 2008.
</p>

<p>
More generally, Felix is interested in language implementation 
issues, such as compiler technology and runtime system design.
Felix is also interested in tools for program understanding
and for assisting in software development.
</p>

<h2 class="boxtitle">Development Projects</h2>
<p>
Felix is one of the developers of 
<a href="http://larceny.ccs.neu.edu/">Larceny</a>
(credit for the design and implementation of Larceny 
 should be attributed to 
 <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lth/">Lars T Hansen</a> 
and <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/will/">Will Clinger</a>).
<!--
<ul>
<li>Felix will however take credit/blame for Larceny's runtime code generation
for both IA32 and CLR.</li>
</ul>
-->
<span hidden>
Felix recently made <a href="LarcenyGfx/index.html#lexermachines">renderings</a> of the state machines for Larceny's 
lexer.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Felix has collected <a href="bookmarklets.html">bookmarklets</a>: little snippets of javascript that
act on whatever webpage your browser is currently focused on.  
The first ones he had seen did things like
post urls to other sites (such as the "Post to del.icio.us" bookmarklet); 
but in fact there are more useful private ones that do things like 
make named anchors in a page explicit in the rendering of the document.
</p>

<p>
<!-- From 2001 through January, 2003 -->
Felix contributed to the development of the 
<a href="http://www.ghs.com/">Green Hills</a> compiler infrastructure
while he was employed there<!-- (from August 2001 through January 2003)-->.
He no longer remembers what else he is allowed to say about his
contributions to their compiler.
But he does remember that Santa Barbara is a beautiful city.
</p>

<p hidden>
<!-- From 1999 to 2001, -->
Felix contributed to the development of the 
<!-- <a href="http://flex-compiler.csail.mit.edu/"> -->
<a href="http://www.cag.csail.mit.edu/~rinard/flex/">
FLEX compiler infrastructure</a>.
</p>

<p>
<!-- From ?1997? to ?1999? -->
Under the supervision of 
<a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~wex/">Alan Wexelblat</a>,
Felix contributed to the development of the Footprints, 
a tool for collecting and interactively presenting information about 
the collective browsing activity of a community.
Sadly the project website is no longer up; more information is available
at Alan's website.

<div class="box" id="life_box">
<a id="life"></a>
<h2 class="boxtitle">Life</h2>
<p>Felix enjoys skiing 
and <a href="http://therecipereader.com/hcindex.htm">cooking</a>. 
</p>
<p>He also likes teaching.  As an example: his attempt
to make a <a href="tutorials/rebound.html">"one page" Javascript tutorial</a> 
  (possibly doomed to failure) aimed at one of his nephews.
  Since then, Felix has tried at various times to promote Literate Programming,
  developing tools that encourage one to treat source code as art,
  such as <a href="https://github.com/pnkfelix/tango"><code>tango</code></a> and
  <a href="https://github.com/pnkfelix/mon-artist/"><code>mon-artist</code></a>.
</p>
<p hidden>
Felix also wrote a <a href="svn-tutorial.html">Subversion tutorial</a>
 that is meant to illustrate a particular work flow and how state
 propagates between subversion users and the central repository.
</p>
<p hidden>
His brother Anson and Anson's wife Jenny are starting 
a food and wine boutique named 
<a href="http://www.picnicseattle.com/">Picnic</a> in Seattle, WA.
</p>
<p>
  Felix became a father in the summer of 2016. His son Logan does not yet, to his knowledge,
  know the &lambda;-calculus.
